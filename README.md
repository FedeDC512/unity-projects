### Unit 1: Simple Car Game
In this project, I developed a simple car game where the player controls a car moving side-to-side on a floating road, avoiding or hitting obstacles. This unit focused on basic Unity editor usage, C# scripting, and foundational programming concepts like functions and variables.

### Unit 2: Animal Feeder Game
This project involves a top-down game where the player throws food to hungry animals charging towards them. Key concepts covered include if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefabs, and instantiation. The game demonstrates basic projectile mechanics and player movement.

### Unit 3: Endless Runner Game
In this project, I created an endless side-scrolling runner game where the player must jump over obstacles to avoid crashing. The unit introduced adding music and sound effects, creating dynamic endless backgrounds, and incorporating particle effects for a more engaging gameplay experience.
