# Unity Projects: Junior Programmer Pathway

Collection of Unity Projects completed as part of the "Unity Junior Programmer Pathway" during the 3D Game Development 2023 course at University of Debrecen, led by [Dr. Kruppa Kinga TÃ¼nde](https://inf.unideb.hu/en/dr-kinga-tunde-kruppa). Each project represents a complete game developed in different units, showcasing the skills and concepts learned along the way.

For a detailed breakdown of updates, changes, and submitted Unity packages after each lesson, please refer to the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/FedeDC512/unity-projects/blob/main/ChangeLog.md). This log provides a detailed timeline of all updates made throughout the course, with each unitypackage linked to its corresponding submission date.

## Prototype 1: Simple Car Game ([Unit 1 - Player Control](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-1-driving-simulation))
In this project, I developed a simple car game where the player controls a car moving side-to-side on a floating road, avoiding or hitting obstacles. This unit focused on basic Unity editor usage, C# scripting, and foundational programming concepts like functions and variables.

## Prototype 2: Animal Feeder Game ([Unit 2 - Basic Gameplay](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-2-basic-gameplay))
This project involves a top-down game where the player throws food to hungry animals charging towards them. Key concepts covered include if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefabs, and instantiation. The game demonstrates basic projectile mechanics and player movement.

## Test Practice: Hero vs Slime
Test Practice is a preparation test for the Mid Term, featuring a game where a hero moves around an enemy slime. The hero can shoot bullets that automatically track and move towards the slime. This project is designed to reinforce gameplay mechanics and combat interactions.

## Mid Term: Animal Feeder Remix
The Mid Term project is an enhanced version of the Animal Feeder Game. In this version, different animals require specific foods, and the player must ensure the correct food is thrown. Additionally, player movement is inverted, and they must find an antidote to restore normal control. The game ends if an animal escapes the screen or if the player feeds animals the wrong food three times.

## Prototype 3: Endless Runner Game ([Unit 3 - Sound and Effects](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-3-sound-and-effects))
In this project, I created an endless side-scrolling runner game where the player must jump over obstacles to avoid crashing. The unit introduced adding music and sound effects, creating dynamic endless backgrounds, and incorporating particle effects for a more engaging gameplay experience.

## Final Project: [Small Animals' Worth](https://github.com/FedeDC512/SmallAnimalsWorth)
Small Animals' Worth is the Final Project I developed for the course. In this game, tiny animals battle against larger ones across three progressively harder levels, each with a different theme and animals. Players can choose to heal or attack while facing opponents with three types of attacks: regular health reduction, bullet hell dodging with objects, and summoning attacks that trigger more bullet hell challenges. The goal is to reduce the enemy's health bar to zero to win. This project integrates advanced Unity concepts, including complex enemy behavior, level progression, and strategic gameplay mechanics.
